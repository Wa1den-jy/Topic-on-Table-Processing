This is a survey on the topic of table processing

#**Table Processing** has long been a difficult problem for computer researchers. The mainstream of the academic world is to divide the problem of table processing into **Table detection** and **Table Structure Recognition**. 

Especially after the rise of **Deep Learning** in 2016, many researchers have entered this field and combined deep learning methods to explore **Table Processing**, which has brought us a lot of inspiration. At the same time, there are still many problems that have not been well solved.

So this is a repository for the collection of **Table Detection** and **Table Structure Recognition** Models and Datasets based on **Deep Learning** methods.
